%p.raleway The Vermont Center for Occupational Rehabilitation prides itself on a goal focused on musculoskeletal rehabilitation both in patients who have acute pain and chronic pain and are Worker's Compensation injuries in the state of Vermont, upstate New York, New Hampshire, or Massachusetts.
%p.raleway The general focus of our treatment program first off is determined by a thorough initial evaluation by Dr. Johansson who has practiced orthopedic and osteopathic medicine for 25 years and the belief is that a successful treatment program and outcome begins with an accurate diagnosis which is clearly explained to the patient. This emphasis on education is a constant running theme utilized by all practitioners in the treatment of these patients. Our treatment involves both sub acute injuries which may be anywhere from 4 weeks to 8 weeks old or more chronic pain syndromes; anywhere from 3-6 months to over a year and we have had great success with both categories of patients.
%p.raleway The essence of the Vermont Center for Occupational Rehabilitation is education and integration with a clearly explained and as accurate as possible diagnosis developed so from the very beginning of the treatment program the patient understands as best they can and as best as Dr. Johansson is able to tell them where their pain may be coming from. Every practitioner follows up with this emphasis on educating patients regarding where the pain is coming from as far as their particular specialty whether it be learning about how the muscles around the area of injury work and how to engage certain muscles that help it and how to disengage certain muscles that do not help it. We have a special education aspect where every several weeks the whole emphasis of the hour is spent on just going over their treatment program, making sure they understand all aspects of it and they understand and our feeling that they are learning about their injury and not just being managed without being taught how to manage their program.

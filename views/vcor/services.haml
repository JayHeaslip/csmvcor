%h2 VCOR Philosophy
%p The Vermont Center for Occupational Rehabilitation prides itself on a goal focused on musculoskeletal rehabilitation both in patients who have acute pain and chronic pain and are Worker's Compensation injuries in the state of Vermont, upstate New York, New Hampshire, or Massachusetts.
%p The general focus of our treatment program first off is determined by a thorough initial evaluation by Dr. Johansson who has practiced orthopedic and osteopathic medicine for 25 years and the belief is that a successful treatment program and outcome begins with an accurate diagnosis which is clearly explained to the patient. This emphasis on education is a constant running theme utilized by all practitioners in the treatment of these patients. Our treatment involves both sub acute injuries which may be anywhere from 4 weeks to 8 weeks old or more chronic pain syndromes; anywhere from 3-6 months to over a year and we have had great success with both categories of patients.
%p The essence of the Vermont Center for Occupational Rehabilitation is education and integration with a clearly explained and as accurate as possible diagnosis developed so from the very beginning of the treatment program the patient understands as best they can and as best as Dr. Johansson is able to tell them where their pain may be coming from. Every practitioner follows up with this emphasis on educating patients regarding where the pain is coming from as far as their particular specialty whether it be learning about how the muscles around the area of injury work and how to engage certain muscles that help it and how to disengage certain muscles that do not help it. We have a special education aspect where every several weeks the whole emphasis of the hour is spent on just going over their treatment program, making sure they understand all aspects of it and they understand and our feeling that they are learning about their injury and not just being managed without being taught how to manage their program. 
%h2 Treatments
%p The treatments that we offer involve a definite integrated and thorough approach to the patient's musculoskeletal injury based on an individual prescription plan arrived at following Dr. Johansson's initial evaluation and treatment recommendations.
%p Typically these treatment recommendations for a patient who has had a more involved injury (anything greater than 3 months) will involve 3 visits per week with an emphasis on myofascial tissue work done by a therapist. Typically this is followed by or preceded by aqua therapy 3 times a week in a pool that is in-house and has one-on-one treatment with a rehab specialist who has specialized training in aqua therapy. The patient will also see another physical therapist that will emphasize and focus on land-based conditioning exercises, the ergonomics of movement and activities of daily living (in other words how during an injury a patient can take care of simple chores of daily living) and maintaining function as to not continue to aggravate their injury. We also have a board-certified psychologist who does not do traditional psychotherapy at all but her emphasis and strength is on monitoring the patient with regards to any issues that have developed into either a situational anxiety or depression associated with being in chronic pain and/or loss of a job if that has been the case as well as loss of many other aspects of daily living. The emphasis of our psychologists when she meets with the patient, and that is only if we feel it is medically necessary, is to address those issues. She also has a specialty in biofeedback which is an extremely helpful tool when combined with the physical therapist demonstrating physical movements as far as exercise prescription is concerned and it teaches patients how to engage certain muscles in a sequence that is proper versus improper thereby not continuing to repeat the same pattern which is in part responsible for continuing to aggravate the underlying injury.
%p Our treatment plans are individualized and integrated and our goal is to restore as much function as possible and we have these modalities that are utilized: Physical therapy, ergonomic education, muscular reeducation, work simulation, work conditioning, myofascial work, aqua therapy, biofeedback, and a variety of other pain management strategies. Dr. Johansson also is a board-certified osteopathic physician so osteopathic manipulative therapy is a tool that is often utilized if medically necessary and he is also a member of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Medicine which emphasizes and focuses primarily on trigger point injections, so trigger point injections are frequently incorporated into the treatment of the program for the patient at the appropriate time and place in the course of rehab whereby that trigger point may be inhibiting the patient's ability to progress.
%h2 Team Meetings
%p An important and extremely helpful aspect to our integrated program is our team meetings which occur with every practitioner and Dr. Johansson as well as nurse case managers on every Thursday. Patients are discussed as to how they are progressing, what changes need to be made, what aspects of the program working and what aspects of the treatment plan are not working. We then will modify that treatment plan at those meeting and it is out of those meetings where we develop a form 20 each week for a patient's work capabilities if that is necessary.
%h2 Typical Treatment Plan
%p The length of treatment varies and is somewhat difficult to predict based on the fact that every patient is different but typically patients are given 3 weeks of a schedule and at the second week they are evaluated with the idea of either maintaining that initial schedule for another 3 weeks or changing the aspects of the program that need to be changed. Once we get the patient progressed to a point of markedly improved function we will discontinue myofascial work, sometimes discontinue pool therapy and progress more to a traditional work conditioning land-based program and work simulation as our goal ultimately is a return to function and work. During the treatment program if work is available and that work meets the restrictions, we will certainly accommodate the employer and try to return that patient to work. However our philosophy is that we do not typically allow people to work on treatment days at least for the first 4-6 weeks because that has so often defeated the purpose of our treatment plan and interrupted our progression with the goals of moving a patient towards full and complete functional restoration.
%p Our goal ultimately is a discharge plan with a home program for self-care which will be a lifetime ongoing experience for the patient as well as a functional capacity that is the best we can get.
%p A typical treatment program depending upon the nature of the injury will be 3 times a week and they will engage in pool therapy daily, myofascial work and then with the physiotherapist for the land-based ergonomic and home exercises. If a psychologist is needed she will engage her services perhaps weekly or every other week and the patient is seen definitely every week by Dr. Johansson to both manage the medications if they are necessary, perform any osteopathic manipulation if medically necessary and/or trigger points if medically necessary. Dr. Johansson also will be responsible for referring patients to other providers for injections that are not able to be provided in the office at the Vermont Center for Occupational Rehabilitation, but the management of that patient's overall rehab plan remains under the care of Dr. Johansson regardless of where the referral takes place or to whom it takes place.
